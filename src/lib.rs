//! Package implement MQTT client and broker.
//!
//! #### Features
//!
//! _*broker*_, enabled by default, provides all the necessary items needed to build
//! a MQTT broker application. Enabling broker, will automatically enable client.
//!
//! _*client*_, enabled by default, provides all the necessary items needed to build
//! an MQTT client. Application that doesn't require a broker can disable default
//! features via `--no-default-features` in cmd-line or via `default-features = false`
//! in [dependency declaration][dep].
//!
//! _*backtrace*_, is library feature that captures backtrace at the point where error
//! is detected by this libarary. Additionally if `logging` is enabled backtace is
//! logged as per the configured log-backend.
//!
//! _*fuzzy*_, is used only by the test infrastructure. Typical application won't have
//! a need for this. Enabling this will provide `arbitrary::Arbitrary` implementation
//! for several types defined in this library.
//!
//! By default `broker` and `client` features are enabled.
//!
//! #### Rust unstable features
//!
//! * [backtrace_frames][us1]
//! * [backtrace][us2]
//! * [error_iter][us3]
